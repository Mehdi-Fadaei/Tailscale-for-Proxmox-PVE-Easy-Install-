üöÄ Installation

1. Clone this repository (or just download the script):

   bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mehdi-Fadaei/Tailscale-for-Proxmox-PVE-Easy-Install-.git
   cd tailscale-proxmox

   Upload this script to each node:

scp install-tailscale.sh root@192.xxx.xxx.xxx:/root/
ssh root@192.xxx.xxx.xxx "bash /root/install-tailscale.sh"


Repeat for all nodes.

Run the installer on each node:

bash
Code kopieren
bash install-tailscale.sh
Follow the login link that appears, sign in with your Tailscale account, and approve the node.

Enable MagicDNS & HTTPS once (only needs to be done once for your network):

Go to https://login.tailscale.com/admin/dns

Enable MagicDNS

Enable HTTPS Certificates

Access your nodes securely:

php-template
Code kopieren
https://<nodename>.<yourtailnet>.ts.net:8006
Example:

arduino
Code kopieren
https://pve1.tail12345.ts.net:8006
Recommended Setup
Give each node a unique hostname before running the script:

bash
Code kopieren
hostnamectl set-hostname pve1
systemctl restart tailscaled
Repeat for pve2, pve3, etc. so that each one has a unique subdomain.

Notes
Free plan friendly: Works even on Tailscale‚Äôs free plan.

Persistent: Survives Proxmox reboots and upgrades.

No port forwarding required: Perfect for home labs or remote datacenters.
